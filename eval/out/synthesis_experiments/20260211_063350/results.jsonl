It is caused by mutations in the C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) gene, leading to a deficiency or dysfunction of C1-INH protein.\n\nThe primary treatment for HAE-IV involves the regular prophylactic administration of C1-INH concentrate. This helps to prevent or reduce the frequency and severity of angioedema attacks.\n\nFor acute attacks, treatments like icatibant (a kallikrein inhibitor) or ecallantide (a C1-INH concentrate) are used.\n\nEcallantide is also approved for the treatment of HAE-IV in patients aged 12 years and older.\n\nTherefore, the available clinical trials for hereditary angioedema type IV are limited. Currently, there are no ongoing clinical trials specifically focused on HAE-IV.\n\nIt is important to note that C1-INH deficiency is the underlying cause of both HAE-IV and HAE-I. While the management strategies are similar, the specific manifestations and severity can differ.\n\nHAE-IV is typically characterized by swelling of the hands, feet, and sometimes the legs, often accompanied by abdominal pain and nausea. Upper airway involvement is less common compared to HAE-I.\n\nThe diagnosis of HAE-IV is confirmed through genetic testing for C1-INH gene mutations.\n\nGiven the rarity of HAE-IV, clinical trial enrollment may be challenging.

Antihypertensive therapy is crucial to slow the progression of kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular risk.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nBased on current guidelines (e.g., KDIGO), ACE inhibitors (ACEi) or Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) are recommended as first-line agents for hypertension in patients with CKD, particularly those with proteinuria. These agents have demonstrated renoprotective effects by reducing intraglomerular pressure.\n\n**Drug Safety Check:**\nThe requested drug safety check for [check_drug_safety] returned a result for dofetilide. However, dofetilide is an antiarrhythmic medication used for atrial fibrillation, not an antihypertensive agent.

Dofetilide is not an appropriate choice for managing hypertension in this patient population.\n\n**Actionable Recommendations:**\n1.  Confirm the patient's specific CKD stage and estimated GFR.\n2.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are a suitable alternative if ACE inhibitors are not tolerated.\n\nRegarding safety, ACE inhibitors can potentially worsen renal function, especially in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or volume depletion. They are also associated with hyperkalemia and angioedema. ARBs carry similar risks, including hyperkalemia and angioedema, but may have a lower risk of acute kidney injury compared to ACE inhibitors in certain populations.\n\nFor CKD stage 3, I recommend starting with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, monitoring renal function (eGFR and creatinine), potassium levels, and blood pressure control.
